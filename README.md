# Milk Chocolate code challenge

## 1. React notification

Your first task is to build a notification system with React framework, which displays a message in an overlay. Some design systems also call it Toast.

Requirements

- Each notification can be one of these 3 types: success, warning and error. The type is required when the notificaion is triggered. If no type is provided, it should throw an console error. The type should be reflected from the UI with different colours of your choice.
- The notification position can be set optionally. The available values are top, top right and bottom right. Default to be top right.
- The notification can be trigger from anywhere within this React application. ie. on page load, button click, form submission, etc.
- Each notificaion should come with a dismiss button. The user can click or tap it to clear the message from the UI.

Bonus

- When trigger the notification, make an optional argument to have the notification message dismissed automatically after X seconds.
- Add animation when the showing or hiding the notification.

## 2. Clock puzzle (optional)

The minute hand and hour hand overlap sometimes. Your task is to write a Javascript or Typescript function that takes the number of minutes elapsed as an input. It should return the number of times the minute hand and the hour hand overlap within that period. The starting position is 12 o'clock and it should be excluded in the count.
